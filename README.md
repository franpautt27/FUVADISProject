# FUVADISProject
Design of a User Interface based on Information Engineering and Web Programming for the attention process in FUVADIS

FUVADIS is a Colombian NGO that seeks to provide assistance to the Venezuelan migrant population and Colombian returnees in vulnerable conditions and currently has 
an assistance process whose main input is the information collected through a 
Vulnerability Matrix. This process is negatively affected by the ineffective management 
in obtaining, storing and managing the information of the beneficiaries, who are currently 
numerous. To improve this, the present project proposed to design and develop a user 
interface to generate a process in a more organized, standardized and fast way. This tool 
was based mainly on information engineering and web programming, with the objective 
of generating a replicable, easy to edit but at the same time secure and reliable response 
to the problem. A pilot test was conducted to verify the performance of the tool, and as a 
result, a significant improvement of the current service in terms of speed, organization 
and security was evidenced

The User interface and the web form can be viewed below:
